# SQL Learning Project

In this project, students will learn fundamental SQL concepts and techniques, 
including database creation using PostgreSQL, writing SQL queries for a case study, 
and utilizing aggregate, conditional, join statements, and union operations.

## Introduction
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful tool for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases.
This project provides hands-on experience with SQL through practical exercises and a case study.

## Learning Objectives
The main learning objectives of this project are:
1. **Database Creation**: Understand how to create databases and tables using PostgreSQL.
2. **SQL Query Writing**: Learn to write SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data.
3. **Aggregate Statements**: Understand how to use aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX for data aggregation.
4. **Conditional Statements**: Learn to use conditional statements such as WHERE, CASE, and IF-ELSE for data filtering and manipulation.
5. **Join Statements**: Understand how to use JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
6. **Union Operation**: Learn to use UNION and UNION ALL operations to combine the results of multiple SELECT queries.

## Case Study
The case study for this project involves a fictional scenario where students are tasked with managing a database for a small retail store. 
The database contains tables for customers, products, orders, and sales transactions. Students will write SQL queries to perform various tasks such as:
- Retrieving customer information
- Calculating total sales revenue
- Finding the most popular products
- Analyzing sales trends over time

## Outlines
### 1. Database Creation
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a new database.
   - Design and create tables for the retail store database.
### 2. SQL Query Writing
   - Write SQL queries based on the case study requirements.
   - Practice retrieving, filtering, and manipulating data using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
### 3. Aggregate Statements
   - Use aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX to perform data aggregation tasks.
### 4. Conditional Statements
   - Filter data using conditional statements such as WHERE, CASE, and IF-ELSE.
### 5. Join Statements
   - Combine data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN operations.
### 6. Union Operation
   - Combine the results of multiple SELECT queries using UNION and UNION ALL operations.

## Usage
1. **Database Setup**: Install PostgreSQL and create a new database for the project.
2. **SQL Practice**: Practice writing SQL queries based on the case study requirements.
3. **Query Execution**: Execute the SQL queries in a SQL client or command-line interface to test and verify the results.
